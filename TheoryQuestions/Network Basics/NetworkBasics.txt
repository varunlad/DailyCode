1. What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?
Answer:
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is used for communication between client and server but is not encrypted.
HTTPS adds SSL/TLS encryption, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity. It also provides authentication via certificates.
SSL/TLS stands for Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security. They are cryptographic protocols that provide secure communication over a network.

2.  What is CORS and why is it needed?
Answer:
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing allows controlled access to resources from different domains, preventing unauthorized requests.

3. Explain CSRF and XSS attacks.
Answer:
CSRF: Exploits user’s authenticated session to perform unwanted actions.
XSS: Injects malicious scripts into web pages.
Prevention: Use tokens, input sanitization, CSP headers.

4. What are secure HTTP headers?
Answer:
Content-Security-Policy
X-Frame-Options
Strict-Transport-Security

5. Explain OAuth and JWT.
Answer:
OAuth: Authorization protocol for third-party access.
JWT: JSON Web Token for stateless authentication.

6. What is HTTPS certificate pinning?
Answer:
Associates a specific certificate with an app to prevent MITM attacks.
(MITM stands for Man-in-the-Middle attack.)
(A MITM attack occurs when an attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters communication between two parties
(e.g., a user and a website) without them knowing. The attacker acts as a "middleman" between the client and server.)

7. How to prevent MITM attacks?
Answer:
Use HTTPS everywhere.
Enable HSTS.
Validate certificates.
