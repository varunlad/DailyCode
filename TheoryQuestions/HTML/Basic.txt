8.What is ARIA in HTML?
  Accessible Rich Internet Applications—attributes that improve accessibility for screen readers.
  <button aria-label="Close menu">X</button>  
  ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes in HTML help screen readers interpret dynamic or complex UI elements that aren’t inherently accessible. 
  For example:
  role="button" tells the screen reader an element behaves like a button.
  aria-label="Close menu" provides a descriptive label for an icon without visible text.
  aria-live="polite" announces updates in real time.
  blind users rely on ARIA attributes indirectly because screen readers use them to convey meaning and state changes. 
  Without ARIA, many custom components (like modals, sliders, or dropdowns) would be confusing or invisible to assistive tech.
