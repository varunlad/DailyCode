1.What is the CSS Box Model?
  The box model describes how elements are rendered as boxes consisting of content, padding, border, and margin.
  Total element size (with box-sizing: content-box) = width + padding + border + margin.

2.What is the difference between display: none and visibility: hidden?
  display: none removes the element from the layout (no space taken).
  visibility: hidden hides it but it still occupies space.

3.Explain CSS specificity.
  Inline styles: 1000
  IDs: 100
  Classes/attributes/pseudo-classes: 10
  Elements/pseudo-elements: 1
  Higher score wins; later rules tie-break.   

4.What are pseudo-classes vs pseudo-elements?
  Pseudo-classes target states (e.g., :hover, :focus, :nth-child(2)).
  Pseudo-elements target parts of elements (e.g., ::before, ::after, ::first-line).

5.Difference between em, rem, px, %, vh, vw?
  em: relative to the element’s font-size (cumulative).
  rem: relative to root (html) font-size.
  px: absolute pixel.
  %: relative to parent property (e.g., width of parent).
  vh/vw: viewport height/width percentages.  

6.When use Flexbox vs Grid?
  Flexbox: one-dimensional (row or column), great for nav bars, buttons.
  Grid: two-dimensional, ideal for complex page layouts.  

7.Explain position: static | relative | absolute | fixed | sticky.
  static: default, flow.
  relative: offset from its normal position, establishes containing block for absolute children.
  absolute: positioned relative to nearest positioned ancestor.
  fixed: relative to viewport.
  sticky: toggles between relative and fixed based on scroll.
