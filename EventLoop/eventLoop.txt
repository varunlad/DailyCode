JavaScript is single-threaded and synchronous by default, but it supports asynchronous behavior through the event loop.
The event loop controls how JavaScript handles asynchronous tasks — deciding whether code goes to:
=============================================================
Call stack → executes immediately (synchronous)
Microtask queue → e.g. Promise.then, async/await
Macrotask queue → e.g. setTimeout, setInterval, setImmediate
=============================================================

The event loop always:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Runs all synchronous code first.(console.log)
2. Then handles microtasks (Promises).
3. Then macrotasks (timeouts, etc.).

It’s responsible for managing and executing asynchronous tasks, callbacks, and I/O operations without blocking the main thread.
