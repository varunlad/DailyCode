Linked List Data Structure
--------------------------

----
A Linked List is, as the word implies, a list where the nodes are linked together. Each node contains data and a pointer. 
The way they are linked together is that each node points to where in the memory the next node is placed.
----

Linked lists consist of nodes, and is a linear data structure we make ourselves, 
unlike arrays which is an existing data structure in the programming language that we can use.

A node contains two things first is data and second is a link that connects it with another node.
The first node is called the head node and we can traverse the whole list using this head and next links.

The last node of the linklist is called as tail and it points to null.

Advantage over Array :
--------------------

A big benefit with using linked lists is that nodes are stored wherever there is free space in memory, 
the nodes do not have to be stored contiguously right after each other like elements are stored in arrays. 
Another nice thing with linked lists is that when adding or removing nodes, the rest of the nodes in the list do not have to be shifted.


Types of Linked Lists :
--------------------- 

1. Singly linked lists
2. Doubly linked lists
3. Circular linked lists
